        Å Radio Roundtable establishes radio and the form of podcast as an alternative learning format. A joint endeavour of knowledge production. The roundtable serves as tool for discussion, and allows us to meet and interview guests. Å Radio Roundtable is organized around themes, that depart from seminars based on Prof. Türetken’s chair, research and Å’s collective work amongst others. It serves as a platform to amplify and voice ideas and transmit these within and beyond the walls of the institution.

<br>
New technologies continue to have an impact on education, and podcasting is no different. In times of (pandemic) crisis, the format of Radio Roundtable has been a crucial form to reach out, create and share knowledge. Technology-enhanced learning via podcasts can increase accessibility, inclusion, engagement and the learning experience.
<br>
<br>
Whereas the geometries of tables can mirror (geopolitical) disbalance, we wish to promote equal participation and to enable conversation with this digital format, that will have an analog counter part.
